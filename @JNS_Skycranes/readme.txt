JNS Skycranes (NATO Taru Helicopters) - Arma 3
===============================================

Features
--------

- Mi-290 Taru and its variants on BLUFOR side (CH-54 Skycrane)
- Taru Pods on BLUFOR side (Skycrane Pods)
- Modular (helicopters and pods in separate PBOs)
- Separate sub-menu for helicopters and pods, keeps the menus clean
- Separate files for adding different texture sets
- Should have no issues with future Arma 3 updates, as config is inherited from the vanilla assets
- Open-source - contribute on GitHub!

Compatibility:
- XENO - Taru Pod Mod


Installation (adopted from Armaholic)
-------------------------------------

Extract into the ArmA 3 Directory, by default this is located in:
  32-Bit - C:\Program Files\Steam\Steamapps\Common\ArmA 3\
  64-Bit - C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steamapps\Common\ArmA 3\

After extraction it should look like this:
  Steam\Steamapps\Common\ArmA 3\@Xeno_Taru_Pod_Mod\addons\

You'll also need to add a Launch Parameter to Steam, in order to do so right-click on ArmA 3 and click Properties and then Set Launch Options.
In the window that opens enter in:
  -mod=@your_mod_folder_name;
For using multiple mods you would then do so like this:
  -mod=@mod_name;@mod_name2;@mod_name3;@mod_name4;@mo d_name5

And of course you can also enable and disable the addon through the in-game Options Expansions menu if you do not want to mess with startup parameters!

The .bikey in Keys folder should only be placed inside the "Arma 3/keys" folder on the Server!
