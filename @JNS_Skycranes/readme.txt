About:
======
- Mi-290 Taru and its variants in different factions (CH-54 Skycrane)
- Taru Pods in different factions (Skycrane Pods)
- Modular (Textures and Factions all in separate PBOs)
- Separate sub-menu in Editor and Zeus to keep it clean
- Should have no issues with future Arma 3 updates, as config is inherited from the vanilla assets
- Open-source - contribute on GitHub!


Compatibility:
==============
- XENO - Taru Pod Mod
